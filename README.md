A halloween themed brick breaker

## Implementation
I changed the colors to fit the spooky theme, red, orange, purple, and green. I added a song to the menu and a different one to the end card. I tried to make these songs spooky. I added sounds to the ball dying and hitting brick. I drew a pumpkin ball and a jack-o-lantern for the highlight and trail. I made it shake and the ball compress just a little. I added a checker shader to the menu and end in the halloween color scheme. I drew a background and put that in all the scenes. I made the eyes follow the ball and be spooky colors. I also added a spooky font
